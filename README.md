# ‚ú® Nebulon: A Lightweight Containerization Runtime

Nebulon is a minimalist containerization runtime built in Rust, designed to provide fundamental container management capabilities including process isolation, resource control, and a streamlined command-line interface. It enables users to create, run, and manage isolated environments efficiently, leveraging Linux namespaces and cgroups.

---

## üöÄ Features

*   **Container Lifecycle Management**: Create, start, and stop containers with ease.
*   **Process Isolation**: Utilizes Linux namespaces (Mount, UTS, PID, Network, IPC, User) to isolate container processes from the host system.
*   **Resource Management**: Integrates with cgroups to set memory and CPU usage limits for containers.
*   **Filesystem Management**: Manages container root filesystems, including mounting `/proc` and setting up a dedicated rootfs.
*   **Volume Mounting**: Supports mounting host directories into containers.
*   **CLI Interface**: A user-friendly command-line tool (`nb`) for all container operations.
*   **Image Management**: Basic commands for importing, listing, and removing container images.
*   **Persistent Storage**: Stores container metadata for persistent management.

## üö¶ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get Nebulon up and running on your local machine.

### Installation

To compile and install Nebulon, you'll need a Rust toolchain (Rustup is recommended).

1.  üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dilibe-Franklin/nebulon.git
    cd nebulon
    ```

2.  üèóÔ∏è **Build the Project**:
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```
    This will compile the `nb` executable and place it in `target/release/`.

3.  üîó **Add to PATH (Optional but Recommended)**:
    For convenience, you can add the compiled executable to your system's PATH:
    ```bash
    sudo cp target/release/nb /usr/local/bin/
    ```
    Alternatively, you can run commands directly using `cargo run --release -- <command>`.

### Environment Variables

Nebulon does not require any specific environment variables for its own operation. However, you can pass environment variables to your containers using the `--env` flag during creation.

## üí° Usage

Nebulon provides a command-line interface (`nb`) for interacting with containers.

### Basic Commands

*   **Initialize Nebulon**:
    This command sets up the necessary base directories for Nebulon.
    ```bash
    nb init
    ```

*   **Create a Container**:
    Creates a new container with specified configurations. The `rootfs` directory (`/var/lib/nebulon/rootfs` by default) must exist and contain a basic Linux filesystem (e.g., a busybox image).
    ```bash
    nb create \
      --hostname my-container \
      --rootfs /var/lib/nebulon/rootfs \
      --workdir / \
      --env PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin \
      --uid 1000 --gid 1000 \
      ping google.com
    ```
    _Example `metadata.json` configuration for container ID `nb-317d1158`:_
    ```json
    {
      "id": "nb-317d1158",
      "pid": 0,
      "status": "Created",
      "config": {
        "command": ["ping"],
        "args": ["google"],
        "env_vars": [],
        "working_dirs": "/",
        "hostname": "orca-container",
        "rootfs": "/var/lib/nebulon/rootfs",
        "uid": 1,
        "gid": 1
      }
    }
    ```

*   **Run a Container**:
    Starts a previously created container.
    ```bash
    nb run <container_id>
    ```
    _Example:_
    ```bash
    nb run nb-317d1158
    ```

*   **List Containers**:
    Displays a list of all managed container IDs.
    ```bash
    nb ps
    ```

*   **Stop a Container**:
    Sends a termination signal to a running container.
    ```bash
    nb stop <container_id>
    ```
    _Example:_
    ```bash
    nb stop nb-317d1158
    ```

### Volume Management

*   **Create a Volume**:
    ```bash
    nb volume create myvolume --driver local
    ```

*   **List Volumes**:
    ```bash
    nb volume ls
    ```

*   **Remove a Volume**:
    ```bash
    nb volume rm myvolume
    ```

### Image Management

*   **Import an Image**:
    ```bash
    nb image import /path/to/my_image.tar myapp latest
    ```

*   **List Images**:
    ```bash
    nb image ls
    ```

*   **Remove an Image**:
    ```bash
    nb image rm myapp latest
    ```
